# main codes to use are saved_datasets_making, TRAINER_20250102, and INFERENCE_20250102

# 20250102
# created new datasets for both left and right movements for shoulder flexion and cross body arm stretch. Both contains 50 repetitions of each exercise and was trained with a window size of 60 with step size of 45
## Additional things to note:
- for the creation of datasets, implemented only extracting arm landmarks from the entire body so as to improve the accuracy and processing of the data within the csv file during prediction\
- Included recording of creating datasets: Able to save the entire video during creating of datasets so as to able to review
